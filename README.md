# PID Speed Control of a DC Motor (Embedded)

## Goal
Design and implement a PID controller to regulate DC motor speed using an encoder.

## What I implemented
- PWM generation (timers)
- Encoder reading (interrupts)
- PID loop and tuning
- Validation with measurements (oscilloscope / plots)

## Results (proof)
See `media/` for step response plots and validation screenshots.

## Files
- `docs/` report
- `media/` measurements and photos
- `src/` source code (if available)

## Tools
C/C++, microcontroller (ATmega/AVR), oscilloscope, power electronics.
